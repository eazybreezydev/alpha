# Project Summary
EasyBreezy is a mobile application designed to help homeowners optimize their air conditioning usage by providing timely notifications on when to open their windows based on real-time weather data and wind direction. Targeted for use primarily in Spring, Summer, and Fall, the app aims to create a lightweight and intuitive user experience, with plans to incorporate ad placements for local window companies in the future.

2. **Weather Data Integration**: Real-time weather conditions including temperature, humidity, and wind information.
3. **Smart Recommendations Engine**: Provides suggestions on when to open or close windows.
4. **Notifications**: Alerts users about optimal window opening times.
5. **Dashboard**: Displays current weather conditions and recommendations.
